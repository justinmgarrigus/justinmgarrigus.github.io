            The responsibilities of a teaching assistant depends on the class 
            and professor, but generally it involves some mixture of grading 
            assignments, leading recitations (which are supplementary 
            regularly-scheduled class sessions), creating learning material for 
            students to better understand the course topics, proctoring 
            students during exams, and sometimes leading entire class periods 
            when the professor is unavailable. The time requirements are 
            usually around 20 hours per week. I was one of the few Master's 
            students at UNT to receive a teaching assistantship! (Usually, 
            Master's students get instructional assistantships; see below.)
            Teaching assistants are salaried and get paid more than 
            instructional assistants do, and they're given more responsibility
            in the classroom.

            Instructional assistants have most of the same responsibilities as 
            teaching assistants do (except they are <i>not</i> allowed to lead
            a recitation section). That means I graded assignments, created 
            learning material, proctored students during exams, and held office
            hours, all in the same way that a teaching assistant would. The 
            main difference between the two roles is that IA's are an hourly 
            position (TA's are salaried) and get paid less than TA's do. IA's 
            are more designed for Master's students, but a select few 
            (including me!) are able to become TA's while still a Master's 
            student.

            This was my first job! I started it after my first semester at UNT.
            As a private tutor, I led online private lessons with one or two 
            students at a time. I would usually get around 10 lessons a week, 
            with each student being aged between 7 and 17 years old. I would 
            usually help students create a long-term project in programming, 
            spanning several months (with some students more than a year!) in 
            game engines or programming languages including Java, Javascript, 
            Python, Unity, C#, C++, PyGame, and others. Other times, students 
            would want tutoring in topics like algebra, geometry, 
            calculus, data structures, algorithms, and more. This was good 
            preparation for my IA and TA positions where I used a lot of the 
            same teaching strategies for an older audience! In total, I taught
            more than 600 private lessons during this time.

            There's an adage that "Linux is free if you don't value your time", 
            and unfortunately, this is even more so with Arch Linux. The amount
            of work this operating system requires would suprise most people, 
            and you might take some things for granted unless you've worked in 
            an environment with much less support compared to Windows (e.g., 
            NVIDIA pushed an update one time that caused Arch systems to stall 
            when their lids are closed). Although, working in Arch Linux 
            is much more enjoyable from a programming and customization 
            perspective; the "everything is a file" design means linking 
            disjoint processes and devices together is very simple, and the 
            open-source nature of the operating system means I can (in 
            principle) control everything that goes on in my computer. It's 
            fun!

            This was a fun project where we had to create a ransomware (in a 
            virtual environment) that encrypted files with a hidden private key
            and then decrypt those files at a later date. I wanted to do 
            something weirder than a standard privilege escalation or 
            something, so I made my own image-viewing application with a buffer 
            overflow vulnerability in it. It would read images as "ppm" files, 
            and would use an unbounded "strcpy" operation that would create and 
            execute an arbitrary executable file if the attacker hid binary 
            code within the pixels of an image. It's based off of a real attack 
            done against the Korean version of a 2003 Windows operating system! 
            Alongside this, I also wanted to manually implement RSA encryption, 
            which involved creating my own prime-number generator in C without 
            any external libraries.

            This project only required we use empirical analysis techniques on 
            some dataset. I was (and still am!) really interested in cellular 
            automata at the time, so I used the "state of the grid at each 
            timestep" as a synthetic dataset and performed various statistical 
            analysis methods to show how different life-like cellular automata 
            variants might change their grid in different ways. I liked all the 
            graphs I made! I secretly want to do more projects involving 
            statistical analysis so that I can create and interpret new graphs.

            I had an ulterior motive while completing this project: we were 
            meant to do a thorough review of an article from FOCS, but I wanted
            to additionally learn more about quantum computing. I chose <a 
            href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9996633">one of the only 
            quantum papers at this conference</a>, which is <i>not</i> a very 
            good introduction to the topic! I read a few other books at the
            same time to help piece things together--including Quantum Physics: 
            What Everyone Needs to Know by Michael G. Raymer (whom I attended a 
            seminar of in 2023!)--and this presentation became both an 
            introduction of quantum physics to the layman audience and a paper
            review like it was supposed to be in the first place.

            This project wanted us to implement a deep-learning system on a 
            new dataset or task. Around the same time I was interested in 
            programming language design and the concept of domain-specific
            languages (especially esolangs), and wondered if it was possible to
            create a programming language that would be capable of learning 
            algorithms built from individual discrete instructions, where
            a human supplies the target inputs/outputs to the algorithm and the
            model learns which instructions to activate in which order to make
            that algorithm. The algorithm-learner turned out to be more 
            complicated of a task than I could do in a semester (and it's
            something transformers have already accomplished, in either case), 
            so I pivoted to making a programming language instead: the user
            passes in a list of instructions as plaintext, and the model 
            executes each by passing each through a list of sub-models (with 
            each trained to implement an individual instruction). The langauge
            works, but is very limited in types of programs it's able to 
            accomplish.

          <p class="main-text">Status: complete</p>

          <p class="main-text"> 
            The polyhedral approach to compilation is a technique where a loop
            in a program is transformed into an equivalent representation that
            reduces the value dependencies between loop iterations. It 
            visualizes array accesses as a function dependent on an affine 
            iterator value, and uses the polyhedral method to skew, translate, 
            or shift the affine polyhedra to make the dependencies a different
            shape with respect to iterator. This project creates my own 
            polyhedral optimizer with the help of different polyhedra-specific
            libraries like OpenScop, Clan, and CLooG. Although, I didn't 
            realize at the time that this takes a good background in math to
            understand how to do it! Specifically, loops require the 
            calculation of a special matrix through a linear-equation solver, 
            which is difficult to compute without knowing what the "Farkas 
            lemma" was (which I didn't...). My solution was to randomize this 
            matrix, compiling the resulting program, and running a collection 
            of tests to ensure the final program was still semantically 
            correct. This means the compiler has the possibility of generating
            programs that don't match what the programmer intended (so it
            should not be used in the real-world), but it does generate 
            programs that are significantly faster in certain cases!

          There's an adage that "Linux is free if you don't value your time", 
          and unfortunately, this is even more so with Arch Linux. The amount
          of work this operating system requires would suprise most people, and
          you might take some things for granted unless you've worked in an 
          environment with much less support compared to Windows (e.g., Zoom's 
          annotate feature shuts off my screen if its used, and my computer has
          a 25% chance of stalling and getting really hot whenever you try to 
          turn it off). Although, working in Arch Linux is much more enjoyable 
          from a programming and customization perspective; the "everything is
          a file" design means linking disjoint processes and devices together
          is very simple, and the open-source nature of the operating system 
          means I can (in principle) control everything that goes on in my 
          computer. It's fun! Although I should probably figure out a solution 
          to that Zoom Annotation issue soon...

          This was a fun project where we had to create a ransomware (in a 
          virtual environment) that encrypted files with a hidden private key
          and then decrypt those files at a later date. I wanted to do 
          something weirder than a standard privilege escalation or something, 
          so I made my own image-viewing application with a buffer overflow 
          vulnerability in it. It would read images as "ppm" files, and would 
          use an unbounded "strcpy" operation that would create and execute an
          arbitrary executable file if the attacker hid binary code within the 
          pixels of an image. It's based off of a real attack done against the
          Korean version of a 2003 Windows operating system! Alongside this, 
          I also wanted to manually implement RSA encryption, which involved 
          creating my own prime-number generator in C without any external 
          libraries.

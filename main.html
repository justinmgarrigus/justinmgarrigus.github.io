          Hello! My name is <span id="firstName"></span>. I'm a computer science student and 
          teaching assistant at UNT currently studying <b>computer 
          microarchitecture</b>. My <a 
          href="./research/media/master-thesis.pdf">thesis</a> is about 
          reducing the amount of duplicated values in the GPU L2 cache for 
          GEMM-based 2D convolution by utilizing a smarter cache mapping 
          function with a side-cache holding extra metadata. This will allow 
          us to reduce the size of the cache without reducing performance!

        <p class="main-text"> 
          Besides that, I'm also interested in other broad kinds of 
          microarchitecture research. The types of problems I like to solve 
          are creating brand-new computers that are really good at solving 
          domain-specific problems. Small-scale problems (e.g., targetting a 
          specific part of the computer like the L2 cache) are familiar to 
          me, but I really want to branch out towards <b>full-system 
          architecture</b> by changing many different parts of the computer 
          all at once in brand-new ways! I want to work on 
          projects that completely change the way computers operate!

          My current work at UNT with GPUs looks like this: 
        </p> 

        <ul class="main-text-list">
          <li>Propose changes that can be made to some part of the GPU
            microarchitecture.</li> 
          <li>Modify the source code of <a href="http://www.gpgpu-sim.org/">
            GPGPU-Sim</a> to reflect this change.</li> 
          <li>Create benchmarks to run on the simulator that demonstrate the 
            benefits and downsides of my changes.</li> 
          <li>Construct figures that show what happens when different key 
            components of the architecture is changed on these benchmarks 
            (e.g., "how does the speed/memory accesses/hit rate change when 
            the number of LSHRs/registers/L1 size changes?").</li>
        </ul>

          I'm currently applying to PhD programs for Fall 2025 or Spring 
          2026, but my day-job is to work as a software engineer at xAI. My
          job mainly consists of creating software that X's LLM, Grok, can
          use to improve in performance. Outside of work, I'm researching GPU 
          computer architecture for accelerating deep learning applications.

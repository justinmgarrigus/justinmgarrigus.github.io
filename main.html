        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>My research focus is on computer architecture and creating new hardware systems that need to be programmed and compiled in unique ways. I'm currently working on projects in GPUs, CPUs, and FPGAs with my advisor Dr. Lizy John. Between January and August 2026, I'll be working as a Research Associate Intern at AMD developing scale-up/scale-out GPU systems.</p>

        </table><h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Hello! My name is <span class="firstName"></span>. I'm a PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin currently studying computer architecture. My advisor is <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YPu9rWUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" target="_parent">Dr. Lizy Kurian John</a>, and my work is with the <a href="https://lca.ece.utexas.edu/" target="_parent">Laboratory of Computer Architecture</a>. During Spring/Summer 2026, I'm working with AMD as a research associate intern developing scale-up/scale-out GPU systems.</p>
        <p>I'm interested in developing exciting things in computer architecture, which makes my research difficult to specify in concrete terms. I want my dissertation to consist of vary different kinds of projects without any kind of throughline, because there are too many interesting things happening in this field to narrow down on any single topic. However, my current projects are focused on adding <i>new instructions</i> to hardware systems, which involves connecting computer microarchitecture, processor/memory systems, software optimization, compilers, and more together.</p>
        <p>My <a href="/research/media/master-thesis.pdf" target="_parent">Master's thesis</a> is (1) an exploration of deep-learning compilers, (2) an L2-cache microarchitecture for reducing duplicated values in lowered im2col convolution, and (3) an analysis of distributed GPU systems evaluating LLM workloads, and was advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7DVxrRoAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_parent">Dr. Hui Zhao</a> at the University of North Texas. My <a href="/projects/media/senior-thesis.pdf" target="_parent">Bachelor's thesis</a> is a detailed investigation of programming languages, syntax vs. semantics, and the introduction of a custom programming language maximizing expressibility of any programming problem, advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hMCK39sAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_parent">Dr. Barrett Bryant</a>.</p>
        <p>My full CV can be found <a href="/cv/index.html" target="_self">here</a>. You can contact me at justingarrigus@utexas.edu.</p>
